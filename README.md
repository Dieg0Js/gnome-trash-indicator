gnome_shell_trash_extension
===========================

A minimalist Trash management extension for the Gnome Shell.

It allows you to:

    * empty the trash (Empty Button)
    
    * open the trash folder (Open Button)
    
    * restore items from trash (Click 0n item)
    
    * delete item from trash (x button)
    

It hides completely when the Trash is empty, and listen for changes in trash directory.
