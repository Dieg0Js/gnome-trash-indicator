Gnome Trash Indicator
===========================

A minimalist Trash management extension for the Gnome Shell.

It allows you to:

    * EMPTY the trash (Empty Button)
    
    * OPEN the trash folder (Open Button)
    
    * RESTORE items from trash (Click on item)
    
    * DELETE item from trash (X button)
    

It hides completely when the Trash is empty, and listen for changes in trash directory.

/home/username/.local/share/Trash

# Manual Installation
Clone the repository to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and restart the
shell.
