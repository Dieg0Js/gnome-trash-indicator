A minimalist Trash management extension for the Gnome Shell.

It allows you to:

- EMPTY the trash (Empty Button)
- OPEN the trash folder (Open Button)
- RESTORE items from trash (Click on item)
- DELETE item from trash (X button)
    

It hides completely when the Trash is empty, and listen for changes in trash directory.

/home/username/.local/share/Trash
